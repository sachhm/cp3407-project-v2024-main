Task: Submit a Cleaning Booking
Goal: Fill out the booking form and attempt a booking (test only, no real payment expected)

Steps Taken:
Landed on the "Book a Cleaning" page.

Quickly filled in:

- Full Name

- Service Type

- Preferred Date

- Selected a Service Type from dropdown (e.g., Medium Clean)

Clicked “Book Now”.

Received confirmation popup stating the booking was successful.

Did not proceed to payment (as this was a test run).

Feedback:
“The form was super straightforward. No confusion at all.”

“I saw the payment button but didn’t click it since I wasn’t actually booking anything.”

“Might be nice if the payment button said something like ‘Proceed to Payment’ so it's more obvious it comes after booking.”

Success Criteria:
Booking data was submitted ✅

User understood the process ✅

Payment skipped intentionally (as planned) ✅
