# Retrospective for Iteration 1

## What Went Well
- We successfully developed a minimum viable product (MVP) that effectively manages customer bookings, provider availabilities, and administrative tasks such as adding or removing providers.  
- The user interface was designed with clarity and usability in mind, ensuring a seamless experience.  
- Our backend setup was structured efficiently, allowing for straightforward deployment and scalability.  

## Areas for Improvement
- Progress in Iteration 1 was slower than anticipated due to limited experience with Agile methodologies and difficulties in selecting a suitable database solution.  
- While team communication was strong, inconsistent meeting schedules impacted productivity and alignment on key tasks.  

## Action Plan for Next Iteration
- Prioritize and complete the remaining user stories from Iteration 1 to maintain development momentum.  
- Foster a more structured Agile approach, including frequent stand-ups and improved sprint planning.  
- Transition MyClean from a basic proof of concept to a fully functional, production-ready application with robust backend and frontend enhancements.
